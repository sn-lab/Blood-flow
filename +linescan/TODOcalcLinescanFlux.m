%UNTITLED7 Summary of this function goes here
%   Detailed explanation goes here

%12-20-04: Finds Flux based on method developed empirically: Thresholds
% image of rotated block data by average; Takes an average projection, and
% thresholds; Finds derivative and zerocrossings to find RBC edges. Uses a
% ratio of standard deviation of intensities across time and space to
% reject some data points.

% TODO: implement this
